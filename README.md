A simple calculator built while learning and experimenting with the [**visionOS**](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/)

Built with visionOS SDK, Swift, and SwiftUI

This project, for now, utilizes most of the universal concepts available in SwiftUI. 

I'll try to add more exclusive features and components to visionOS in the future!
